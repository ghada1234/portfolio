<p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, <br/>painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised<br/>
during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the <br/>poetry and visual art of the Romantic<br/>
Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by 20th-century critic <br/>Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion<br/>
to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His<br/> visual artistry led 21st-century critic<br/>
Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has <br/>ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was<br/>
placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[4] While he <br/>lived in London his entire life, except<br/>
for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically <br/>rich collection of works, which embraced the<br/>
imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]</p>

<p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic <br/>views, he is held in high regard by later<br/>
critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and <br/>mystical undercurrents within his work. His<br/>
paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement <br/>and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has<br/>
been said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] <br/>A committed Christian who was hostile to<br/>
the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion),<br/> Blake was influenced by the ideals and<br/>
ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he <br/>rejected many of these political beliefs, he<br/>
maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he <br/>was also influenced by thinkers such as<br/>
Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the singularity of <br/>Blake's work makes him difficult to classify.<br/>
The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as a <br/>"glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not<br/>
forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be <br/>replaced by known or readily surmisable<br/>
successors".[14]</p>
